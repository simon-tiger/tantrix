Tantrix Game in JavaScription

This is unfinished community project. I collected the 56 hexagonal tiles from contributors (via this webpage I built: https://simon-tiger.github.io/tantrix-encoding-challenge/)and started building the game. Feel free to use the code to finish the game (it's an open source community project). I am going to finish it myself at a later date.
